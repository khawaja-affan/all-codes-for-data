      <h2>Welcome to PakistanPedia</h2>
      <p>
        PakistanPedia is a modern, comprehensive encyclopedia dedicated to Pakistan.
        It covers the nation's rich history, geography, culture, economy, politics, and much more.
        This platform serves as a digital source of verified and updated information on every
        aspect of Pakistan — from the majestic Karakoram ranges to the political corridors of Islamabad.
      </p>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Pakistan is a country located in South Asia. It shares borders with India, Afghanistan, Iran, and China.
        With a population of over 240 million people, it is the fifth-most populous country in the world.
        Pakistan was created on August 14, 1947, under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pakistan is known for its natural beauty, strategic location, resilient people, and cultural diversity.
        From the deserts of Thar to the green valleys of Swat, Pakistan offers unmatched beauty.
        Its official language is Urdu, and Islam is the state religion.
      </p>
      <p>
  Pakistan is a country celebrated for its dramatic and varied landscapes, from the desert dunes of Thar to the towering glaciers of the Karakoram and Himalayas. In recent environmental initiatives, the northern mountains saw a **4.4‑magnitude earthquake on June 14**, which thankfully caused no major damage—testifying to both the region’s seismic sensitivity and the resilience of its communities.</p>

<p>
  It holds a key strategic position bridging South Asia, Central Asia, and the Middle East. In response to escalating tensions with India—including missile exchanges and airspace concerns—Pakistan announced a **17–20 % rise in defence spending for FY 2025‑26**, with a budget now at roughly ₹2.55 trillion (~$9 billion) despite broader fiscal cuts.</p>

<p>
  The nation's diverse heritage is woven into its languages, customs, and cultures: Urdu unites people of many ethnicities, while Islam shapes daily life and national identity. Politically, Pakistan continues to navigate international diplomacy—with recent headlines noting the U.S. **denying an invitation** to Army Chief Asim Munir for its 250th anniversary parade, reflecting Washington’s careful balancing act between Islamabad and New Delhi.</p>

<p>
  Pakistan’s economy is gradually stabilizing, projected to grow around **2.7% to 3% in FY 2024‑25**. While inflation has slowed from its peaks, middle-class households in Karachi and beyond still face stagnant incomes and rising living costs—a situation prompting cautious optimism supported by an IMF $7 billion loan program.</p>

<p>
  In agriculture and water management, under the national **Green Pakistan Initiative**, several canal projects are underway—like the Cholistan Canal in Punjab—which aim to irrigate vast semi-arid lands. These efforts, seeking to boost farming output, are sparking debate over environmental impact and downstream water rights, particularly in Sindh.</p>

<p>
  Sports and civil life also remain vibrant: cricket fans celebrated Lahore Qalandars winning the **2025 PSL title** (May 25) with captain Kusal Perera earning Man of the Match honors. Meanwhile, attention is turning toward the **Pakistan team’s T20 tour to Bangladesh in July**, ahead of major international events.</p>
